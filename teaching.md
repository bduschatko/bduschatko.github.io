I'm excited to be able to provide learning resources for both experts and non-experts alike. The following is a collection of notes and lectures that I have prepared to enhance the educational experience of others, and they are freely available to use. The collection will be added to with some regularity. If there's a topic you'd like to see, feel free to get in touch and ask about it!

These resources are still under construction - they will begin being released in the near future.
