Low dimensional materials have generated significant excitement in recent years due to the exotic properties they exhibit. Perhaps most well known is graphene, which is an atomically thin arrangement of carbon atoms. These systems have superior electrical conductivity properties, for example, and could play an integral role in next-generation electronic devices. Are the transition-metal dichalcogenides. Utilizing state-of-the-art imaging, we examine how experimentally observed disorder impacts the transport properties in materials from first principles DFT.
