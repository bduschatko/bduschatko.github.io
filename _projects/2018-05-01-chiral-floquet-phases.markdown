Among the growing class of topological matter, by far the most common are those that are classified by equilibrium topological phases. However, there also exists a more exotic and less familiar class of non-equilibrium topological phases. These occur, for example, in Floquet system, and they exhibit behaviour that would otherwise be impossible in a static setting. One such example are chiral Floquet phases, which possess unidirectional edge channels for quantum information. Of particular interest, we examine how the topological invariant of these systems can be reformulated in terms of entanglement entropies, which are physically more intuitive and experimentally more accessible.
