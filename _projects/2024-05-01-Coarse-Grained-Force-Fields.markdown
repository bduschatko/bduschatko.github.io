Molecular dynamics is an essential in the study of dynamics for many complex systems. However, systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, as well as those containing long time-scale processes such as protein folding, can quickly become inaccesible with traditional techniques. A popular approach to overcome these difficulties is to "coarse grain" a system to a latent space representation, effectively freezing out fast degrees of freedom. I'm interested in using machine learning techniques to develop force fields for these latent space systems.  

_Code available soon_
