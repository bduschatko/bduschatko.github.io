Encoding physical symmetries has shown to be a promising avenue towards more accurate, physics-aware machine learning models. In particular, capturing the equivariant, rather than just invariant, behavior of molecular systems, has lead to the next generation of force fields. In this space, I have worked on a number of different advancements. One such example are ionic liquids, an important class of systems for battery electrolyte materials. In addition, I have explored new multi-modal learning frameworks that seamlessly incorporate thermodynamics into different classes of machine learning models, including equivariant neural networks. Finally, I have spent time exploring efficiency improvements using NVIDIA's cuEquivariance package, as well as implementing new batching strategies for enhanced sampling.
