Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the primary tools for studying quantum systems. The utility of the theory lies in the off-loading of complicated non-local interaction information of an electronic system into the so-called exchange correlation energy functional. Numerous approximations to this quantity exist, but none are sufficient to accurately describe the physics of strongly correlated systems or Van der Waals materials. Recent advances in machine learning suggest that it is possible to learn complex functionals that may be better suited to study these non-traditional systems within the DFT formalism.
