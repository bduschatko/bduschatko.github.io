The solubility of compounds in different solvents is a critical property in numerous applications. These can be used to examine the relative behavior of biological small molecules in aqueous versus organic liquid environments found in the body. Alternatively, solubility is important for studying gas absorption for gas storage applications. We aim to explore novel ways of accurately and efficiently predicting the solubility of small gas molecules in systems where Widom insertion techniques are a viable approach.
