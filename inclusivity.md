title: Inclusivity Statement
---

As a non-binary / transgender identifying individual, inclusivity has a particularly important place in my life. In order to help everyone succeed and thrive, I will always aim to create and maintain spaces that are inclusive and safe for all individuals. As an advocate for other queer folks, I strive to
- enhance the visibility of queer people in science by being an outspoken figure
- provide accessible learning opportunities to under privileged, aspiring scientists
- help others navigate spaces that are traditionally oppressive to queer people
- engage in outreach to promote the growth of talent for all individuals

I am more than happy to speak with other advocates, and you are welcome to contact me. Any queer scientist who has felt a lack of visibility or support in the community is also encouraged to reach out to me. You are seen, you are valued, and you belong.
