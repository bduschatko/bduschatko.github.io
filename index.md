As a physicist by training and computational chemist in practice, I work at the intersection of fundamental physics of molecular systems, machine learning (ML), and high performance computing (HPC). I have over 6 years of experience in 
- Developing and deploying atomistic and coarse grained ML force fields for molecular dynamics
- Creating Python and C++ computational workflows and optimizing for CPU and GPU machines
- Applying a variety of computational chemistry techniques to a host of material problems
- Leading projects from conception to publication in high-impact peer-reviewed journals

My research interests center on creating impact and bringing meaningful change. Atomistic and coarse grained simulations are particularly valuable in drug discovery, battery materials research, and climate-impacting initiatives such as carbon capture. You can keep up to date on my research efforts [here](/projects).  

As an extension of doing impactful work, I aim to make science more accessible to a larger audience. Journal articles are often geared towards field experts, making it challenging for both scientists outside the field and non-scientists to keep up with scientific progress. Moreover, I am a firm believer that not everyone learns in the same way. To this end, having access to a variety of approaches to teaching can enhance the learning experience for others. As such, I hope to contribute to the body of educational content available by providing my own perspectives and presentations of scientific topics. These resources are [freely available](/teaching) through this website.

I'm always happy to engage with the community at large, in addition to offering support to [under represented groups](/inclusivity). If you'd like to get in touch about opportunities, collaboration, or general discussion, please feel free to connect on LinkedIn and/or contact me with the information below.

I received my B.S. degree in Physics from The University of Texas in Austin. Advised by Professor Andrew C. Potter, I completed an honors thesis on quantifying quantum information transfer in chiral Floquet phases. As an undergraduate, I was recognized as a Dean's Honored Graduate for excellence in academics and research and graduated with highest honors in physics. I completed my M.S. and PhD in applied physics in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Working in the Materials Intelligence Research group of Professor Boris Kozinsky, I led the groups efforts in designing coarse grained free energy models with different machine learning frameworks. During this time, I received an award from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), administered as a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity. The award offered full funding for my PhD research and was renewed succesfully all 4 years of eligibility.
